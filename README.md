I create interactive as well as accessible user experiences 👩🏽‍💻

🔭 I’m currently working on building features for Underdog Devs as one of the Lead UX Engineers 

🌱 I’m currently learning how to build better user interfaces and experiences

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on educational, social justice, or any projects that will bring about doing social good

⚡ Fun fact: My love for ramen stems from my love for Naruto Uzumaki
